      <description>A Brief on Dependency Injection Dependency Injection, also known as Inversion of Control, is a design pattern used to loosely couple dependent objects. It makes the fifth principle of the SOLID design principles.

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
